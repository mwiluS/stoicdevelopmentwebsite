Each page is pre-built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, meaning it’s perfect for businesses that need a straightforward online presence—like a brochure site, portfolio, or informational page. It’s easy to set up, requires less maintenance, and is ideal for displaying static content like text, images, and contact details.</p></div>

Unlike static websites, dynamic websites pull data from databases, allowing content to update automatically or based on user input. This type of website is perfect for businesses that need features like user accounts, blogs, product catalogs, booking systems, or forums. It offers more flexibility and personalisation, providing a more interactive experience for visitors.</p></div>
